# About

The software consists of multiple parts, especially https://github.com/FabianGermany/Homescreen-Instrument-Cluster, https://github.com/FabianGermany/Navigation-System-Instrument-Cluster and https://github.com/philipnglr/agl-html5-navigation.

The mockup-files created with Figma software can be seen in the mockup folder.

How to run easily in a browser:
- npm install
- npm run build
- npm start
- Type http://localhost:9002/ in a browser such as Firefox Developer Edition.

It's still recommended to run the software in a AGL virtual machine. This process is more complex. For that you will need - apart from the AGL virtual machine - another Linux virtual machine to download the data and generate the wgt-file. 
With some commands using SSH you can transfer the wgt-file to the AGL virtual machine. For that see our documentation which is not published here on GitHub. If needed, feel free to get in touch with us.
